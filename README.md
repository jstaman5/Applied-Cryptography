# Applied-Cryptography
This repository showcases many of the interesting labs I did in CS 583: Applied Cryptography.

## Project 1: AES
For this project, I had to implement AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) using the 51-page [FIPS 197 specification](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf). 
This was a great learning experience on how to write code using industry standards (specifically US government standard). 
Understanding and reading through technical jargon and mathematical formulas of the FIPS 197 was difficult at first, but after completing this project, 
I felt much more confident on reading standards/technical documents. 

### What is AES?
AES is an encryption algorithm. It is an example of symmetric key cryptography, meaning that both the sender and receiver share a key.
