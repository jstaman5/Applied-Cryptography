Hash Attack
C++/used hashlib++ library for SHA-256

The two programs made for this lab were preimage.cpp and collision.cpp. 

How to compile and run preimage:
g++ preimage.cpp hl_sha256.cpp hl_sha256wrapper.cpp -o preimage
./preimage bitsize num_of_tests


How to compile and run collision:
g++ collision.cpp hl_sha256.cpp hl_sha256wrapper.cpp -o collision
./collision bitsize num_of_tests
