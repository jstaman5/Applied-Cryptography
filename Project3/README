Jared Staman
CS 583 Lab 3: Mac Attack

I used an already existing sha-1 implementation taken from https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/hashes/sha1.py
The modifications to the implementation to allow the mac attack are pointed out in the program, but basically I made changes to where the sha-1 starts and its padding.

How to run:
python mac_attack.py [Alice's msg] [Mallory's msg]

The output should be matching. It first tests how Mallory would perform the attack without knowing the key, and then tests using the key.
If you want to change the key, just go into the program and change the default key from '0000000000000000' to whatever 16 byte string you want
